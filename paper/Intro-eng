1. introduction
automated machine learning (AutoML) is now a popular field in computer science, because the ultimate goal, automating the machine learning process, which reduce the human efforts and computational resource.
to achieve the goal, lots of researches proposed method on different stage of AutoML, e.g., data preparation, data preprocess, hyperparameter optimization, and neural architecture search (NAS). among them, NAS has recently gain a big amount of attention. 

training-free NAS is main stream

2. what is unknown?
score functions have low correlation

3. how and why
one score function can only evaulate one perspect/characteristic of a architecture, leading to poor prediction.

4. method
try to merge three different score functions, which are highly heterogeneous. so that, we can evaluate a architecture from different aspects.

5. results
expect the result shall find a good architecture.

6. discssion
based on the expectation, the method can find a good architecture since the three heterogeneous score functions can evaluate a architecture from different ways.

7. conclusion
